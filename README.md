# Anonamailer

This is a program I wrote back in 2011 when I was first starting to learn how to create C# programs using Winforms.
The program allows you to enter an SMTP server and then send an email to any email address from any email address.
It has not been updated to the latest standards using SSL or TLS and does not allow for authentication to the server but it should be easily modifiable.
This is an educational program and I accept no responsibilities for any damages caused by it's use.
