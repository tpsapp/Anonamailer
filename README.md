# Anonamailer
Created: 9/30/2011

I created this application as an attempt to understand how the System.Net.Mail.MailMessage and
System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient work in Visual C#.  It very simply allows you to send an email to anyone
from any email address you enter.  I also incorporated using Application Settings so I did not have
to save settings to a file or to the registry.
